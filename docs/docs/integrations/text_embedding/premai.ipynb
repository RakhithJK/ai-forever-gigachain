    "Before proceeding further, please make sure that you have made an account on Prem and already started a project. If not, then here's how you can start for free:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sign in to [PremAI](https://app.premai.io/accounts/login/), if you are coming for the first time and create your API key [here](https://app.premai.io/api_keys/).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Go to [app.premai.io](https://app.premai.io) and this will take you to the project's dashboard. \n",
