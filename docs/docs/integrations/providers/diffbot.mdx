<<<<<<< HEAD
>[Diffbot](https://docs.diffbot.com/docs) is a service to read web pages. Unlike traditional web scraping tools, 
> `Diffbot` doesn't require any rules to read the content on a page.
>It starts with computer vision, which classifies a page into one of 20 possible types. Content is then interpreted by a machine learning model trained to identify the key attributes on a page based on its type.
>The result is a website transformed into clean-structured data (like JSON or CSV), ready for your application.

Diffbot's [Extract API](https://docs.diffbot.com/reference/extract-introduction) is a service that structures and normalizes data from web pages. 

Unlike traditional web scraping tools, `Diffbot Extract` doesn't require any rules to read the content on a page. It uses a computer vision model to classify a page into one of 20 possible types, and then transforms raw HTML markup into JSON. The resulting structured JSON follows a consistent [type-based ontology](https://docs.diffbot.com/docs/ontology), which makes it easy to extract data from multiple different web sources with the same schema.
